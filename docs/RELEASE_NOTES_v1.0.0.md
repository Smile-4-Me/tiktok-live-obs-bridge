# TikTok Live OBS Bridge v1.0.0

## First release

TikTok Live OBS Bridge brings the TikTok LIVE session workflow into an OBS dock. It can manage multiple local profiles, prepare a LIVE session through Streamlabs, and optionally update an Aitum Stream Suite output with the generated stream URL and key.

### Highlights

- Multiple TikTok profiles in one OBS installation.
- Browser login, Streamlabs Desktop token import, or manual token verification.
- Optional Aitum output selection and automatic URL/key handoff.
- Manual mode for streaming workflows without Aitum.
- Protection against output and TikTok-account conflicts across profiles.
- Output-start verification and cautious session recovery after OBS closes unexpectedly.
- English and German dock UI.
- Windows installer with regular and portable OBS support.

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 x64.
- OBS Studio compatible with the v1.0.0 build.
- Aitum Stream Suite is optional.
- A Streamlabs/TikTok account that is eligible for the features you want to use.

### Before you install

- Close OBS Studio.
- Run the installer as administrator.
- Select the correct root folder of the OBS installation you want to extend.
- Restart OBS when setup finishes, then open **Docks → TikTok Live OBS Bridge**.
