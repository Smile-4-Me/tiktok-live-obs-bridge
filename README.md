# TikTok Live OBS Bridge

TikTok Live OBS Bridge was built because repeatedly opening a separate tool, copying a stream URL and key, and pasting both into an OBS setup is tedious. It keeps that workflow close to OBS while leaving the streamer in control.

It is a community project, not a company product. Please read the information below before using it.

## What it does

- Keeps multiple local TikTok profile configurations in one OBS installation.
- Connects a profile through Streamlabs Desktop, a browser login, or a token you provide.
- Shows whether an account appears ready for PC LIVE access.
- Creates and ends TikTok LIVE sessions, including stream title, game category, and 18+ request.
- Can update a selected Aitum Stream Suite output with the generated stream URL and key.
- Can also be used without Aitum: copy the generated credentials into another streaming workflow.
- Prevents two profiles from reserving the same Aitum output or TikTok account at the same time.
- Checks whether Aitum actually started an output and cleans up a newly created session when it did not.
- Recovers cautiously after OBS is closed during a LIVE session.

## Important boundaries

- **Windows only for v1.0.0.** macOS and Linux are not supported yet; see [PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md](PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).
- **Aitum is optional.** The plugin works in manual mode without it.
- **Nothing here is affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by TikTok, Streamlabs, Aitum, or OBS Studio.**
- The Streamlabs/TikTok flow used by this plugin is not a public TikTok API contract. Providers may change, restrict, or remove it at any time.
- You are responsible for your account, stream content, and compliance with the terms and rules of every service you use. This project does not promise account eligibility, uninterrupted streaming, or any particular platform outcome.

## Installation

1. Download `TikTok-Live-OBS-Bridge-Setup-1.0.0.exe` from the release you trust.
2. Run the installer as administrator.
3. Select the root folder of the OBS installation you want to extend. Portable OBS installations are supported.
4. Restart OBS Studio.
5. Open **Docks → TikTok Live OBS Bridge**.

The installer always asks which OBS installation to use. It does not silently choose one and it keeps portable OBS instances separate.

For manual installation and update behavior, read [docs/INSTALLING.md](docs/INSTALLING.md).

## Quick start

1. Open the dock and create or select a profile.
2. Connect the Streamlabs TikTok account.
3. If TikTok still needs to approve PC LIVE access, use the link shown in the dock and refresh the account information later.
4. Choose an Aitum output, or leave the output in **Manual usage** mode.
5. Add optional stream metadata and create the LIVE session.
6. With Aitum, start the selected output as usual. Without Aitum, copy the generated credentials into your streaming software.
7. End the LIVE session in the dock when the stream is over.

## Data and privacy

Profile names and non-secret preferences are saved per OBS installation under the current Windows user's local OBS configuration directory. Streamlabs tokens and generated stream credentials are stored in **Windows Credential Manager**, not in the plugin's INI files.

See [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md) for the exact storage model, its limits, and how uninstalling handles configuration.

## Building from source

The source is included so the plugin can be inspected, improved, and built independently. The current build requires Windows, CMake, Visual Studio Build Tools, compatible Qt 6 headers/import libraries, and an OBS source tree matching the target ABI.

Detailed, reproducible instructions are in [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Credits and respect

This project exists because other projects made the problem understandable:

- [Loukious/StreamLabsTikTokStreamKeyGenerator](https://github.com/Loukious/StreamLabsTikTokStreamKeyGenerator) — the GPL-3.0 reference project whose observed flow and ideas informed this implementation. Thank you, Loukious.
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) — the broadcasting platform this plugin extends.
- [Aitum Stream Suite](https://aitum.tv/) — optional output management integration. This project does not bundle, modify, or represent Aitum.
- [curl](https://curl.se/) — HTTPS transport, linked under the curl license.
- Qt — the UI toolkit supplied by OBS in the supported runtime.
